Hi Dear Professor and tutor,
In this link, there are three documents, which are 'Code','Dataset'and'Results'.
In 'Code' document, the m file named main is the main program code of the project, and the others are codes that support the running of the main program. In addition, the m file named ‘Speech_signal_preprocessing’ is an additional program for preprocessing speech.
In ‘Dataset’ document, you can find all the databases used to train the model, which are recorded in Chinese. Among them, the database content mainly uses six different emotions for speech presentation of the same sentence.
'Results' document contains the results obtained by running the main file and the sample results of speech signal preprocessing.
